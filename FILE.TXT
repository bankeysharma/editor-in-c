1.  BOURNESHELL OVERVIEW


The BourneShell is both a command-line interpreter and a high-level programming language.  When it is acting as a command-line
interpreter, it processes commands as you enter them at the command prompt.  When you use it as a programming language, it processes
commands that are stored in files known as BourneShell scripts. This course will show you how to create and execute BourneShell scripts.
We will explore BourneShell programming including such features as variables, control structures, processes, and executable files.

The BourneShell is one of three shells available on most UNIX systems.
Bourne is the accepted standard for System V UNIX.  The other shells are being used more and more.  The other shells are
the CShell and the KornShell.  The CShell is BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) UNIX. BSD was developed at the University of

California at Berkeley, California. Most of the features found in the BourneShell are also found in the other shells; there are
differences, however.  The CShell and KornShell are not standard on UNIX System V but are generally available.

BourneShell scripts allow you to group command lines together and execute them by entering a single command at the command line. This
allows complex functions to be completed by any user, and repetitive functions can be completed easily.  Input and output
can also be redirected from a BourneShell script.

1.1  What is the BourneShell?

BourneShell is a high level programming language and a command line interpreter.
The command to invoke the BourneShell is:

  Command Format:  sh [-acefhiknrstuvx] [args]

  (See Appendix A for a complete list of options etc)

A Shell script is an executable plain file that contains UNIX and shell commands. To execute the shell script type the name of the
script at the prompt. A simple shell script called shell_ex is shown in the following example. The output from the execution of
the shell is also shown.

Sample Session:

 $cat shell_ex
 echo "This is a very simple shell procedure "
 echo "created with the basic echo command "
 echo "and three other very basic commands "
 echo
 ps
 echo
 who
 echo
 ls
 $sh shell_ex
 This is a very simple shell procedure
 created with the very basic echo command
 and three other very basic commands

1.2  Making a Bourne Shell Script Executable

A BourneShell script is an ordinary file that contains commands which can be executed in sequence by entering one command at the
BourneShell prompt.  In order for a script to be executed, it must first be executable.  This is done with the chmod command.

Sample Session:

 $cat shell_ex
 echo "This is a very simple shell procedure "
 echo "created with the basic echo command "
 echo "and three other very basic commands "
 echo                                                          
 ps                                                            
 echo
