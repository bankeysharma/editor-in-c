1.  BOURNESHELL OVERVIEW


The BourneShell is both a command-line interpreter and a high-level programming language.  When it is acting as a command-line
interpreter, it processes commands as you enter them at the command prompt.  When you use it as a programming language, it processes
commands that are stored in files known as BourneShell scripts. This course will show you how to create and execute BourneShell scripts.
We will explore BourneShell programming including such features as variables, control structures, processes, and executable files.

The BourneShell is one of three shells available on most UNIX systems.
Bourne is the accepted standard for System V UNIX.  The other shells are being used more and more.  The other shells are
the CShell and the KornShell.  The CShell is BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) UNIX. BSD was developed at the University of

California at Berkeley, California. Most of the features found in the BourneShell are also found in the other shells; there are
differences, however.  The CShell and KornShell are not standard on UNIX System V but are generally available.
